If you have a folder with images in the folder, the program will look for the folder name, listed on line 26, 
and try to match dates to each image.  It produces several files and a new directory with the name of the 
original folder to identify the item we’re looking at. The file we want to look at is the one with an 
extension ‘.html’, which tries to match the expected date with a crop from the image file with the 
actual date for the file.  When there’s a mismatch, I’ve been putting any ‘extra’ files in a separate folder 
I create, called ‘item_XX_discards’.  If any files are actually missing, I’ve copied a blank sheet 
(attached here as ‘missing.jpg’) and added in the item number before the missing page, with the 
suffixes ‘a’ and ‘missing’.  If, for example, file ’003.jpg’ should be the second page of June 3-6 1880 
but instead it’s June 7-9 1880, I made a copy of the ‘missing.jpg’ and renamed file ‘002a_2_missing.jpg’, 
the ‘2’ to represent the second page.
